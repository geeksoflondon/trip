##How are we getting there?

We will be travelling on the TIME Eurostar departure from London St Pancreas to Brussels on Wednesday 2nd May.

There will be time for a short break in Brussels before heading to Rotterdam and finally Delft South.

The meeting place inside St Pancreas is outside Eurostar Reservations next to the luggage trolleys. Please arrive before TIME at the latest to make sure there is enough time to issue your ticket. 


##What do I need to bring to Delft?

###Personal Stuff

* Your self
* Your passport or National ID Card (for EU residents)
* â‚¬65 cash for the kitty

###Clothes

We do not have anything specific but we suggest you don't bring your Sunday best. You also will probably needs things you don't mind getting muddy or wet.

###Sleeping 

The bunk beds come equipped with a basic form mattress and a pillow so you will want:

* A sleeping bag
* A single size base sheet and pillow case

We will have three dorms. Last year this was split (snoring / non-snoring / ladies).

###Other

What ever you like but you will need to be able to carry it all the way to Delft.
