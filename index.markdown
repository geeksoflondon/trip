##Location

![Hey Kruithuis](http://geeksoflondon-old.heroku.com/trip/images/kruithuis.jpg)

<p class='info'>"Het Kruithuis" (The Armory) is on the outskirts of Delft and it's a 4 minute walk from train station Delft South which has trains going all night and day to Amsterdam, The Hague, Rotterdam, Brussels, and more. It's about 25 minutes to walk to central Delft but there are lots of public transport options.</p>

The Armory is a complex of 3 buildings. Which ones we use will depend on how many signups we get. The buildings are normally used by scouting so the facilities are simple but sufficient for what we need.

This includes bunk beds spread over multiple rooms, big kitchens, big open spaces, outdoor benches (we're hoping the weather is going to be nice) fire places, rustic pool, outdoor BBQs, and all the other standard facilities.

##What is it going to cost and when do I need to pay?

The cost varies so before we talk about costs lets talk about what you're going to get!

* Travel on Eurostar from London St Pancreas (optional)
* A bunk bed for the 5 nights
* The chance to explore one of Europe's flattest countries
* Breakfast & dinner every day at the Kruithuis
* A good supply of beer, wine and soft drinks
